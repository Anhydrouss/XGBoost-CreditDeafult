# XGBoost-Credit Deafult

Output Summary

In XGBoost, the F score is a measure of the importance of each feature in the model. The higher the F score of a feature, the more important it is in the model. The F scores are computed based on the relative importance of the features, so they are normalized and can be compared to each other. The RMSE (root mean squared error) is a measure of the model's performance on the test data. It is calculated as the square root of the mean squared error between the true values and the predicted values. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
