# XGBoost-CreditDeafult

Output Summary

In XGBoost, the F score is a measure of the importance of each feature in the model. The higher the F score of a feature, the more important it is in the model. The F scores are computed based on the relative importance of the features, so they are normalized and can be compared to each other. The RMSE (root mean squared error) is a measure of the model's performance on the test data. It is calculated as the square root of the mean squared error between the true values and the predicted values. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

In this case, the RMSE of 0.22 indicates that the model is able to predict the target variable with an error of about 0.22 on average. This may or may not be a good performance, depending on the context and the desired level of accuracy. The F scores of the features indicate that the first two features are the most important ones in the model, with the third feature being less important. This information can be useful for understanding the importance of each feature in the model, and for deciding which features to keep or remove in future iterations.

There could be several reasons why the F scores of the features obtained using XGBoost differ from the correlations between the features and the target variable obtained using logistic regression. First, it is important to note that the F scores in XGBoost are computed based on the relative importance of the features in the model, while the correlations are a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. These two measures are not directly comparable, as they capture different aspects of the data.

Second, the F scores in XGBoost are computed based on the impact of each feature on the model's predictions, taking into account the interactions between the features. The correlations, on the other hand, are a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables, but they do not consider the interactions between the variables. This means that a feature with a high correlation to the target variable may not necessarily have a high F score if it does not interact significantly with the other features in the model.

Finally, it is also possible that the discrepancy between the F scores and the correlations is due to the different algorithms used to fit the models. Logistic regression and XGBoost are two different machine learning algorithms that use different approaches to model the data. As a result, they may produce different results even when applied to the same data.

In summary, the F scores in XGBoost and the correlations between the features and the target variable are two different measures that capture different aspects of the data and should not be directly compared.
