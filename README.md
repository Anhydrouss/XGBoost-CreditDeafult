# XGBoost-Credit Deafult

Output Summary

In XGBoost, the F score is a measure of the importance of each feature in the model. The higher the F score of a feature, the more important it is in the model. The F scores are computed based on the relative importance of the features, so they are normalized and can be compared to each other.

The RMSE (root mean squared error) is a measure of the model's performance on the test data. It is calculated as the square root of the mean squared error between the true values and the predicted values. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

In this case, the RMSE of 0.22 indicates that the model is able to predict the target variable with an error of about 0.22 on average. This may or may not be a good performance, depending on the context and the desired level of accuracy.

The F scores of the features indicate that the 'Credit status code' and 'AccountStatus' features are the most important ones in the model, while the 'DelinqAlert' feature is less important. This information can be useful for understanding the importance of each feature in the model, and for deciding which features to keep or remove in future iterations.

Based on this information, recommendations for the next study:

Keep the 'Credit status code' and 'AccountStatus' features, as they are the most important ones in the model.

Consider removing the 'DelinqAlert' feature, as it is less important in the model. However, make sure to also consider other factors such as the availability of the data and the importance of the feature for the business problem.

Try to improve the model's performance by tuning the hyperparameters, adding or removing features, or using a different machine learning algorithm. You can also try to increase the amount of training data or improve the quality of the data to see if that helps improve the model's performance.

Consider evaluating the model's performance on additional metrics, such as precision, recall, or the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), to get a more complete picture of the model's behavior.
